./run input.txt <command>

where <command> is

-pc : to output list of cubes to a file called cubes_list.txt
-pv : to output list of variables to a file called vars_list.txt
-pm : to output the cube-variable matrix to a file called matrix.txt
-ppr : to output the prime rectangles to a file called prime_rects.txt

restricted.txt, which contains restricted prime rectangles and
the final optimal solution is always output and does not require
any command.
