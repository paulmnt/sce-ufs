PROGRAM BASIC INFO:
	- Language is C++
	- No special requirements. The tool can be compiled with g++ and it was tested on CLIC machines


LIST OF FOLDERS AND INSTRUCTIONS:

./build
	- contains the Makefile and the executable.
	- when verbose mode is enabled the tool will create the folder all-PLAs within this directory.

	- to build the tool:
	     $> cd build
	     $> make

	- to build with DEBUG printouts enabled: decomment the -DDEBUG flag and add it to $(CPPFLAGS) the Makefile.

	- to show the tool help
	     $> make help
	     or
	     $> make
	     $> ./ufs --help

	     The tool will show the following:
	     Usage: ufs [flags] <pla_file_1> <pla_file_2>

	      --help            : Displays options

	      --verbose         : Enables verbose mode and prints all
              			  the intermediate PLAs into all-PLAs

	      --single_disjoint : Enables rule B7 to terminate if one
                     		  cover has a single cube, while the
                     		  other has non intersecting cubes.

	      --multi_disjoint  : Enables rule B8 to terminate if both
              			  covers have non intersecting cubes.

	      --scc X           : (Not Implemented) SCC on covers with
                     		  at most X cubes before rule checking


	      - Notice that scc is a simplification rule, which we though of, but was not a requirement.


	- to run the regression test
	     $> make test

	- to run the tool with custom input files
	     $> ./ufs [options] <input_file_1> <input_file_1>
	     for example
	     $> ./ufs --verbose ../tb/f1.pla ../tb/g1.pla

	- to clean the folder
	     $> make clean


./doc
	- contains the tex and the Makefile of the write up

./src
	- contains source (*.cpp) files and header files (*.h) of the tool.

./tb
	- contains the input PLAs for the regression test.
